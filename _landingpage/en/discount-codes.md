This page explains my discount policy, which was created to ensure the fairest pricing policy for all customers.

**Non Profits**

I do offer a discount to [non-profit organisations]({% link _landingpage/en/non-profit.md %}) who want to use the Kimai-Cloud.

There is no discount for plugins in self-hosted installations.

**Cloud**

If you choose a paid plan with Kimai-Cloud, you will receive a 20-25% discount if you pay it annually instead of monthly.

**Purchasing Power Parity**

Many countries have a lower GDP than my home country Austria.
To make it easier for these countries to utilize Kimai I give out PPP discounts.
To find out if you are eligible for a discount, go to this [Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_GDP_(nominal)_per_capita), 
and compare your countries GDP per capita with the below table. 

| GDP per capita | Discount |
|----------------|----------|
| <  2.000       | 90 %     |
| <  5.000       | 80 %     |
| < 10.000       | 70 %     |
| < 15.000       | 60 %     |
| < 20.000       | 50 %     |
| < 25.000       | 40 %     |
| < 30.000       | 30 %     |
| < 35.000       | 20 %     |
| < 40.000       | 10 %     |
| < 45.000       | 5 %      |

If you [contact me](mailto:support@kimai.cloud), don't forget to add proof like your company registration.

**Black friday**

I never run seasonal promotions like Black Friday or Christmas deals.

All discount codes found on discount code websites are fake and will not work.
