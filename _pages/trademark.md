Kevin Papst owns and oversees the trademark for the name <mark>Kimai</mark>.

Trademarks are a signifier of a product’s identity and reputation, two things that are vitally important for an open source project like Kimai.
In FOSS projects where the code and all of the “traditional” intellectual property is open,
the thing that everyone can rely on as a marker of quality and trust is where the trademark is allowed to be used.

Putting the mark on something is a really big deal and should protect that value for the integrity of the entire community.
The trademark usage policy was developed with the following goals in mind:

1. Make it easy for anyone to use the name <mark>Kimai</mark> and logo for community-oriented efforts that help spread and improve Kimai.
2. Make it clear how Kimai-related businesses and projects can (and cannot) use the <mark>Kimai</mark> name and logo.
3. Make it hard for anyone to use the <mark>Kimai</mark> name and logo to unfairly profit from, trick or confuse people who are looking for official Kimai resources.

### Usage Policy

Permission from Kevin Papst is required to use the Kimai name or logo as part of any project, product, service, domain name, or company name.

Permission will be granted to use the Kimai name and logo for projects that meet the following criteria:

- The primary purpose of your project is to promote the spread and improvement of the Kimai software.
- Your project is non-commercial in nature (it can make money to cover its costs or contribute to non-profit entities, but it cannot be run as a for-profit project or business).
- Your project neither promotes nor is associated with entities that currently fail to comply with the AGPL license under which Kimai is distributed.

If your project meets these criteria, you will be permitted to use the Kimai name and logo to promote your project in any way you see fit with one exception:
Please do not use Kimai as part of a domain name.

All other Kimai-related businesses or projects can use the Kimai name and logo to refer to and explain their services, but they cannot use them as part of a product,
project, service, domain name, or company name and they cannot use them in any way that suggests an affiliation with or endorsement by Kevin Papst or the Kimai open source project.

For example, a consulting company can describe its business as “Super Web Agency, offering Kimai consulting for small businesses,” but cannot call its business “The Kimai Consulting Company.”
Similarly, a business related to Kimai plugins can describe itself as “Acme Plugins, the world’s best Kimai plugins,” but cannot call itself “The Kimai Plugin vendor.”

Similarly, it’s OK to use the Kimai logo as part of a page that describes your products or services, but it is not OK to use it as part of your company or product logo or branding itself.
Under no circumstances is it permitted to use Kimai as part of a domain name or top-level domain name.

It is not allowed to use the trademark in advertising, including AdSense/AdWords.

Please note that it is not the goal of this policy to limit commercial activity around Kimai.
I encourage Kimai-based businesses as I would like to see a vibrant community and more companies providing commercial services.

When in doubt about your use of the Kimai name or logo, please [contact Kevin Papst](mailto:{{ site.support_email }}) for clarification.
