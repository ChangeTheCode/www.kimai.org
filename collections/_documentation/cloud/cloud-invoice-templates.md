You can use your own custom invoice templates to render them in your corporate design.

Kimai supports multiple invoice formats, the most important ones being PDF, DOCX (Word), XSLX (Excel) and ODS (OpenOffice).

## Uploading templates

The self-management screen at `Invoice > Templates > Documents/Upload` allows you to upload files in the formats DOCX, ODS, XLSX.

### PDF templates (Twig)

If you want to use Twig templates for HTML or PDF format, you have to [contact the support](mailto:{{ site.cloud.support_email }}).
Due to security measurements, all Twig templates need to be verified by the development team prior to upload.
Please ZIP and mail them to our support email at [support@kimai.cloud](mailto:{{ site.cloud.support_email }}).
