    When freelancing is a new chapter in your life, you have to try out new roles and face new challenges. One of these is time management and balancing the hours you work with the profitability of your projects. Balancing multiple projects requires analysis, both for you and your clients.

    But there are tools out there to help freelancers, contractors, digital nomads and solopreneurs track their billable hours, bill clients without pulling your hair out, manage your hourly rates and expenses, etc.

    It lets you focus on what you love - and get paid what you really deserve. Let's see how with Kimai as a time tracking tool for freelancers.
