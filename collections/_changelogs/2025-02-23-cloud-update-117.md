This update introduces two new beta tests:

1. **New setting for attendance tracking:** You can now configure a project specifically for calculating working contract times. When this setting is enabled, only time entries for this project will be counted as attendance time.
2. **Recording of Break Times:** This is an early draft of the feature. If youâ€™re interested in participating in the beta test, please contact our support team.

Other improvements in this update: 

- Graceful fallback for missing working-contract mode
- Export dates (e.g. `project start and end`) did not respect the timezone
- Validation added for `company` and `title` fields in InvoiceTemplate
- Updated translations
